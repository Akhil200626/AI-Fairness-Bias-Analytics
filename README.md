# AI Fairness & Bias Analytics

## Overview
This project presents a statistical audit of machine learning predictions to identify and quantify demographic bias.
The focus is on fairness analytics—measuring disparity, error imbalance, and distribution skew—using transparent,
interpretable metrics.

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using only NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to emphasize
foundational understanding and reproducibility.

---

## Objectives
- Audit model predictions across sensitive demographic groups
- Quantify bias using established fairness metrics
- Visualize disparity and error imbalance
- Provide clear, explainable insights for responsible AI deployment

---

## Key Fairness Metrics
- **Demographic Parity**
- **Disparate Impact**
- **Group-wise Error Rate**
- **Confusion Breakdown by Group**

All metrics are computed manually to ensure clarity and correctness.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

No external fairness libraries are used.
